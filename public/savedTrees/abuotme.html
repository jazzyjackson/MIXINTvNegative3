Why are you interested in software?
Helping people with computers was easy
raised by a spreadsheet afficianado
sucked into into algebra and robots
like should I tell my life story?
More recently, 
  
What lead me to code?
  I've written code one way or another for a long time
  I started with lego robots when I was like 10 years old.
  I got a lot of practice when I was doing youth education at UIUC.
  Decided to just do what I was best at, to provide as much value to the world as I could
  (was kind of balancing this thought with other interests. Architecture. Botany.
   but it seemed too daunting. I would be a crummy architect for a long time. Better to
   run with the thing I was already ahead)
  At Hackers On Planet Earth XI, I realized 
  
  
What do I want to do?
  I want to make cutting edge technology more accessible
  such that more people can enact their own ideas
  instead of techies designing solutions for other people
  tech to make it easier to solve your own problems

  I want to lessen learning curves to new technology
  so as to make it less exclusive
